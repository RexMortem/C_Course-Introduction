# C Course Session 1 

A basic, and hopefully gentle, introduction to the C Programming Language.
This session covers the very basics of C i.e. concepts that are present in every other language like variables, for loops, and functions; this session will also introduce the concept of undefined behaviour and how C likes to handle - or not handle - things. 

## What is the C Course?

The C Course is a 4-week long course on the basics of C Programming made by UWCS (University of Warwick Computing Society).
You can find out more about the society at [their website]("https://uwcs.co.uk").
