# C Course Session 1 

A basic, and hopefully gentle, introduction to the C Programming Language.

This session covers the very basics of C i.e. concepts that are present in most other languages like variables, for loops, and arrays; this session will also introduce the concept of undefined behaviour and how C likes to handle - or not handle - things. 

## What is the C Course?

The C Course is a 4-week long course on the basics of C Programming made by UWCS (University of Warwick Computing Society).

You can find out more about the society at [their website](https://uwcs.co.uk). 

## How to use this repository

If you're using DCS machines and don't know how to navigate Linux, use the [Linux 101 Guide](https://uwcs.co.uk/resources/linux-101/).

1) First, clone the repository. If you're new to git then go to the folder you want to store the session in, and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RexMortem/C_Course-Introduction
```

2) Read **Session1.pdf**; if you're on DCS machines, you can do this using **evince** or **okular** among other tools. If you're using your own machine, then most web browsers should work. Regardless of the device, I personally prefer opening pdfs in Chrome, Firefox or similar. 
    - Note the pdf has HTML elements including links/anchor elements (which limited pdf readers may not read properly, including GitHub's file preview)
        - The topics in the contents lists are hyperlinks which should make navigating the document much easier
    - Alternatively, you can also read through the markdown file **Session1.md** 

3) If you're really struggling then you can find sample solutions to exercises from the session inside `cFiles/exerciseSolutions`. Do have a look at the solutions after you've written a solution that you're convinced is right; it might give you ideas for how to improve your code. Please don't just read the solutions without attempting the exercises `:)`
